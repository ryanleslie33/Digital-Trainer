## Project Description
## Name of Student: Ryan Leslie
## Name of Project: Digital Trainer
## Project’s Purpose or Goal: (Give users a quick and easy guide to learning how to workout without having to hire a personal trainer)
## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
_successfully call and receive work-out images from api_
_upload previous workouts to database_
_Have a functional user-orientated UI_
## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* _wrk-manager API_
* _firebase data-base or mySQL depending on if C# is implemented_
* _React, Redux_
## _If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific._
* _Host website on AWS cloud_
* _Adding a goals feature with BMI calculator to help guide them to their goal of gains or losses_
* _I'm not sure what else to add because the goal of this app was to keep it minimal and simple and clean and after MVP is done will really focus user-orientation._
## _What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?_
* _AWS_
* _?_
* _?_
## _Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?_
* _I had a couple other ideas but felt this was more completable with such a short amount of time and I wasn't sure if I wanted to use C# or not I have no clue on how to use it with React and would not even need to for this project for the most part other than using it just for practitioner purposes, especially since its been so long since I have used that language._

* _Application that helps guide a user on what exercises to do what exercises there for specific regions of there body._
