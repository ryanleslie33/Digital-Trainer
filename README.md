# _Digital Trainer._

#### _School course in creating a web app in React/Re-dux, C#, Entity Frame Work, mySQL._

#### By _**Ryan Leslie**_

## Project Description

* _Application that helps guide a user on what exercises to do what exercises there for specific regions of there body. This applications front end is all React with redux, the back end is C# that renders my mySQL data while using Entity Frame Work. When each button is clicked an API call is made from my react component that calls my server to retrieve the information. The data from the database includes information and images on specific one week workout plans and workouts for specific muscle groups. This application also includes a history component that records all your completed workouts and uploads them to the database._
